# Adventure Works Cycles Report

Welcome to the Adventure Works Cycles Report project! This repository is dedicated to building a comprehensive report and dashboard for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to create a report that tracks Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), compares regional performance, analyzes product-level trends, and identifies high-value customers.

### Project Stages

The project is divided into several stages to systematically develop and refine our report:

### Stage 1: Connecting & Shaping Data
In this stage, our focus is on building automated workflows using Power Query to extract, clean, transform, and load our project data.

### Stage 2: Creating a Relational Data Model
Stage 2 involves applying data modeling best practices such as cardinality, normalization, and star schemas. We will construct the AdventureWorks data model to ensure efficient data relationships.

### Stage 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
In this stage, we utilize Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures. We will explore concepts like row and filter context, and employ powerful DAX functions for advanced calculations.

### Stage 4: Visualizing Data with Reports
Stage 4 focuses on visualizing our data through reports and dashboards. We will build and format basic charts, enhance interactivity with bookmarks, slicers, parameters, tooltips, and optimize report navigation for a seamless user experience.
